# MERN Places React App

This is a React Frontend App. The app allows users register and add places of interest. Users can view other users places.
The app is linked with and consumes the [MERN Places Backend](https://github.com/barryrlmurphy/mern-places-backend), which is a number of REST APIs built on a node / express backend.
